  <txt><![CDATA[STRATA is the scrambled pseudo primary sampling unit (PSU) collapsed stratum variable designed for use with CLUSTER in Taylor series linear approximation for correction of complex sample design characteristics. See the CLUSTER variable description for more details. The combinations of levels of STRATA variables define the strata in the sample, that is, where strata are non-overlapping subgroups that were sampled independently. These variables are mainly used to group observations into PSU clusters when computing standard errors. 

Sampling weights will often produce correct point estimates (such as means and variances). Some researchers may use additional techniques for the purpose of analysis and variance estimation. ATUS has provided STRATA and CLUSTER variables for this purpose. 

In the Stata software, researchers may submit the svyset and svydes commands once to define these variables in a data set (including sampling weights such as WT06). Other software may require that STRATA and CLUSTER be identified for each individual analysis. 

Users should note that STRATA and CLUSTER are not available for ATUS respondents whose final CPS interview was in April 2014 or later; these cases are assigned a value of 9999. To generate correct standard errors from April 2014 forward, users should use replicate weights (RWT06).]]></txt>

  <labl>Person weight, 2006 methodology</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[WT06 provides ATUS respondent weights based on the weighting methodology introduced in 2006. WT06 is available for all years and is the preferred weighting variable to use for most analyses.  It is the only weighting variable that is suitable for use in analyses that combine time use data from 2006 and later with data for earlier years.  The methodology used to construct WT06 ensures that the sums of the respondent weights add up to the appropriate number of weekday person-days and weekend person-days over the quarter, both for the population as a whole and for selected subpopulations. 

All ATUS weights are probability weights. Users should take care to specify them properly in their statistical packages.

Because the ATUS sample is not a simple random sample, standard errors calculated using the default options in most statistical packages will not be correct.  Calculation of correct standard errors requires the use of replicate weights.  RWT06 may be used in conjunction with WT06 for this purpose; for further details, see the description of RWT06.]]></txt>

  <labl>Labor force status</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[EMPSTAT indicates whether persons were part of the labor force--working or seeking work--and, if so, whether they were currently unemployed. 

Employment status was determined on the basis of answers to a series of questions relating to their activities during the preceding week. Those who reported doing any work at all for pay or profit, or working at least fifteen hours without pay in a family business or farm, were classified as "at work." Those who did not work during the previous week but who acknowledged having a job or business from which they were temporarily absent (e.g., due to illness, vacation, bad weather, or labor dispute) were also classified as employed, under the heading "employed - absent." 

Unemployed persons make up the third element of the labor force. Individuals were coded as unemployed if they did no work for pay or profit, did not have a job from which they were briefly absent, and answered yes to a question about whether they had been looking for work in the past four weeks. People who were temporarily laid off from a job were also classified as unemployed. 

Persons who were neither employed nor unemployed fall into the residual category, "not in labor force." Such individuals might be retired, disabled due to an illness lasting at least 6 months, occupied with other activities such as attending school or keeping house, or convinced that they are unlikely to find employment (discouraged workers).

EMPSTAT was collected at the time of the ATUS interview.  Employment status was also collected at the time of the final CPS interview, 2-5 months before the ATUS interview.  See EMPSTAT_CPS8.  EMPSTAT_CPS8 distinguishes between not being in the labor force due to retirement, disability, or other reasons, but EMPSTAT does not.]]></txt>
