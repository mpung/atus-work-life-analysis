## Work-Life Balance Analysis by Occupation and Education Level

This project will analyze how work-life balance varies across different occupational groups and education levels, with special attention to changes over time. The project will use IPUMS ATUS data. The ATUS is the first federally administered ongoing time use survey in the United States. It collects detailed information on how people spend their time across more than 400 different activities during a designated 24-hour period. The survey has been conducted annually since 2003. IPUMS Time Use harmonizes these data and provides a data extract builder that allows users to create custom time use variables and data extracts for analysis. 
#### Tentative Research Questions:

1. How does time allocation to work, leisure, household activities, and personal care differ across occupational categories?
2. What is the relationship between education level and time spent on various activities?
3. Have these patterns changed over time, particularly before and after major economic shifts - financial crisis, COVID-19 pandemic?
4. Are there significant gender differences in work-life balance within the same occupational categories?
